## Hi there! 👋

My name is Yanbo Wang (王彦博).

I'm a freshman university student majoring in Electronic Engineering. 

I come from a small county near the Changbai Mountains in China, where I've developed a passion for digital technology, photography (especially film), and travel.

In addition to my academic interests, I'm also the founder of [Web3Club](https://github.com/Web3-Club/) and JLUBA(JiLin-Universities-Blockchain-Alliance),

a community dedicated to promoting Web3 and blockchain technology， and a union of students who study blockchain at universities in JiLin Province,China.

I'm excited to be part of this growing ecosystem, and I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and collaborate with others.

### 🏆

My project: Chain Food has also reward **ETH Shanghai 2023 Public Good No.3 🥉**

When I'm not studying or working on projects, you can find me indulging in some of my favorite foods, 

like McDonald's double cheeseburgers (Chinese mainland McDonald's 1+1 package is PERFECT!). 

I also enjoy cycling and listening to music by artists like **Sakanaction, 草东没有派对, John Lennon, 汪峰, 痛仰乐队 and 二手玫瑰乐队.**

My future objectives include achieving economic independence and perhaps moving to Japan 🗾 or Northern Europe 🇪🇺.
